## Outline:

* Why bother giving a good talk?

<br>
  <!-- So many people give rubbish talks -->
  <!-- (Selling your research) -->
  <!-- (Time to effort ratio) -->
  <!-- (Trailer) -->
  
* Conveying your message

<br>
  <!-- (Pitch) -->
  <!-- (If someone summaries your talk after) -->
  <!-- (Can't tell people everything - don't expecet to either) -->
  <!-- (What do you want to convey) -->
  <!-- (Timing vs Key points) -->
  <!-- (Storyboarding) -->

* Relationship with your audience

<br>
  <!-- (Contract) -->
  <!-- (How much do you want people to understand) -->
  <!-- (Pitch should differ based on your audience) -->
  <!-- Style -->
  <!-- Nerves -->
  <!-- Questions -->
  <!-- Opportunity to come back to you -->
  
* Slide layout

<br>  
  <!-- (Text - don't put anything up you don't want people to read!) -->
  <!-- (Say it in it's simplest form wherever possible) -->
  <!-- (Give people the opportunity to come back in) -->
  <!-- (Interactive graphics as a tool - when to use them) -->
  <!-- (Caution: Slides get shared afterward) -->
  <!-- (Caution: Backup) -->
 
# Why bother?

<div class = "notes">
* Most talks begin with a motivation - this talk is no different
* Important to answer the questions why bother
* Most talks are rubbish so why should you put in the effort

<div class = "notes">
Extreme value theory or extreme value analysis (EVA) is a branch of statistics dealing with the extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions. It seeks to assess, from a given ordered sample of a given random variable, the probability of events that are more extreme than any previously observed. Extreme value analysis is widely used in many disciplines, such as structural engineering, finance, earth sciences, traffic prediction, and geological engineering. For example, EVA might be used in the field of hydrology to estimate the probability of an unusually large flooding event, such as the 100-year flood. Similarly, for the design of a breakwater, a coastal engineer would seek to estimate the 50-year wave and design the structure accordingly.

## Set of key messages

<center><span style="color:#099EA2"> **Can't tell people everything!!!**</span>
</center><br>

3 minute talk = 1 idea

10 minute talk = 1 - 2 ideas and a bit of background

20 minute talk = A few (2 - 4) of ideas and introductory background

etc.

# Audience

## Pitching 2.0

<br><br><br><center>
<span style="color:#099EA2"> **Which key messages do you want your audience to understand?** </span> </center> 
<br>

Audience:

* Masters and PhD students at different levels
* Researchers from the application, not mathematically trained
* Important people in your field

## Temptation

<br><br><br>
<center>
<span style="color:#099EA2"> **Pack your talk full of complicated maths** </span>
</center>
<br>

<center>
<span style="color:#099EA2"> **DON'T DO IT!!!** </span>
</center>
<br>

<div class = "notes">
* No one in your audience is going home after disappointed because they understand your talk!
* People may think it's a waste of time on the other hand if they can't understand any of it!
</div>

## Contract 

* As a speaker your job is try to communicate your reserach

* As an audience member your job is to listen

## Contract 

* As a speaker your job is try to communicate your reserach

* As an audience member your job is to listen

<br><br><center>
<span style="color:#099EA2"> **If you break the contract as a speaker**</span> 
<br> 

<span style="color:#099EA2"> **The audience can break their contract** </span>
</center>

## Communicating with your audience

**Some suggestions:**

* Keep ideas in their simplest possible form

* Where possible, develop in stories in a dual way   
eg. skoof, proof by picture
  
* Tell the audience how it's relevant to them

<div class = "notes">
* Make an effort to communicate your ideas
* If people understand they will engage
* If you are clear people will follow!
</div>

## Questions

<center> **If the audience engaged with your talk you will get asked questions!** -<span style="color:#099EA2">  **Getting asked questions is good!** </span>

<div class = "notes">
* This is my barometer for how well people understood my talk
* How well I explained concepts
* What people found interesting
* Get excited about questions
* People ask questions because they are curious!!!
</div>

## Question Fear

<center>
Giving talks and getting asked questions is scary for some people

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7abrH8o4HMgEAV9e" width="480" height="241" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/starwars-3o7abrH8o4HMgEAV9e">via GIPHY</a></p>

<div class = "notes">
* As a young researcher questions scared me (still do sometimes)
* You can simply say - let's discuss that afterwards or I don't know
* You are in the power seat!!
* For a long time I was scared of giving talks
* Mostly because I saw some very bad behaviour in my Honours from a member of the audience who berrated a young speaker
* Since then I've realised - bad behaviour at talks isn't about you!
* In one of my first talks at conference I got an equation wrong
* What happened - wrote it on a piece of paper, slipped it to me afterward politely, he thanked me for my effort.

## Pink elephants

**Scientific thinking in words - David Lindsay**

* Book about scientific writing
* Covers: paper writing, talks, posters, presentations
* Written by for more general science, still applicable to mathematics
* Highly recommended
* Makes this interesting point about "pink elephants"
* Which is where people reading your slide and not paying attention
* So you can basically say anything - like pink elephants!!!
* Or touch your nose

<span style="color:#099EA2"> **clear accompanying slides takes time** </span>

<br>

* Okay to give the same talk more than once!

* You probably won't give an amazing talk the first time

* Improve aspects of your talk each time 

## Upward mentoring

<br><br><br>
<center><span style="color:#099EA2">  **If you are a supervisor:** </span>

* Let your student know you are in their corner 

* Encourage them to get out there and try

<div class = "notes">
* Thanks to Peter Taylor for encouraging me and given me opportunity to practice giving talks
* Acems gives thoughts of opportunity - very lucky!!
